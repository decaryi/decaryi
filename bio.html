        <!--<h2>Decaryi</h2>-->
        <p>Decaryi is an audiovisual project that focuses on exploring new sounds and textures through improvisation. Its music is a dynamic interplay between chaos and order, harmony and noise. The compositions often evoke a sense of melancholy and introspection, drawing the listener into an emotional landscape that is simultaneously beautiful and unsettling.</p>

        <p>Decaryi studied communication design at Hochschule Augsburg, which has helped him develop skills in creating visually appealing audiovisual experiences. His work combines the organic with the analog and the flexibility of the digital to create a unique sensory experience.</p>
