        <h2>Concept Album</h2>
        <p>"Mesmositio" is an album that was created during a study abroad semester. It is composed entirely of samples recorded on location. The album also features two fitting music videos, in which footage from that time is edited and distorted. It is an experimental audiovisual representation of the Corona pandemic, with all sounds and music created from processed field recordings and street music.</p>
