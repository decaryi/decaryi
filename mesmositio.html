        <h2>Concept Album</h2>
        <p>"Mesmositio" is an album that was created during a study abroad semester. It is composed entirely of samples recorded on location. The album also features two fitting music videos, in which footage from that time is edited and distorted. It is an experimental audiovisual representation of the Corona pandemic, with all sounds and music created from processed field recordings and street music.</p>

        <h2>Goticulas</h2>
        <p>"The video for the song Goticulas was a collaboration with Oliver Skovronek. We designed the music video to be raw and direct, in line with the sound of the music. The central idea was to create feedback loops, which we arranged in the space. It was important for us to work experimentally during the creation process. Therefore, we always worked spontaneously, improvising and optimizing the structure and flow with each session. This allowed us to address the unique artifacts and characteristics that arose from working with feedback loops.</p>
