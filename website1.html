        <h2>Experimental Music Video</h2>
        <p>We designed the music video to be raw and direct, in line with the sound of the music. The central idea was to create feedback loops, which we arranged in the space. It was important for us to work experimentally during the creation process. Therefore, we always worked spontaneously, improvising and optimizing the structure and flow with each session. This allowed us to address the unique artifacts and characteristics that arose from working with feedback loops.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Technology-wise, we used After Effects to generate the basic animations. Then, we translated these digital animations into the analog world to give them a more tactile feel. We used a projector to project the animations onto a surface, which was then filmed by a camera. This newly created image was then projected back onto the wall with another projector. We recorded the resulting feedback loops separately with a camera and used that footage to edit the final video, syncing it to the music.</p>
