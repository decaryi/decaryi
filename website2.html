        <h2>Generative Installation</h2>
        <p>Generative room installation that is fed with audio and video data from visitors. These data are manipulated and distorted in their playback. The installation abstractly deals with the representation of the individual in digital space, where the individual loses significance and reality is only portrayed in a distorted manner.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The visual component of the installation was implemented using Touch Designer, while MaxMsp was used for sound processing. The data was captured using an old iPhone and directly sent to both programs. In both programs, the recorded data was stored in buffers to be later played back in a distorted manner.</p>
