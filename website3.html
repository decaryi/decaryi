        <h2>Audiovisual Soundperformance</h2>
        <p>Most sound visualizations depict a creative interpretation of the audio rather than the sound itself. However, in the case of "Klangstrahlen," the sound is directly and analogously translated, allowing the audience to experience the audio in real-time.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To achieve this, the technology of old CRT televisions was modified to no longer display a video signal, but instead represent the sound from modular synthesizers. The audio signals are connected directly to the electromagnets of the televisions, creating a unique and immersive audio-visual experience during the live performance.</p>
