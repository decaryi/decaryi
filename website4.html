        <h1>Schematics</h1>
        <h2>orginal and modified synth schematics and code</h2>
        <p>The majority of the schematics I have modified for my modular synthesizer are based on Eurorack standards, which are widely used in the electronic music community for their compatibility and versatility. These schematics, which I have painstakingly customized to suit my specific needs and preferences, have undergone extensive modifications to align with my creative vision and unique sound design requirements. Through careful experimentation and meticulous tweaking, I have fine-tuned these Eurorack schematics to integrate seamlessly into my modular synthesizer setup, allowing me to explore a diverse range of sonic possibilities and push the boundaries of my musical expression to new heights.</p>
